Script for fixing future dates in Skype chat history. On running, lets the user
choose a Skype history file and shifts the timestamp of future messages to
the past by a specified number of days.

Background: message dates in Skype chat are given timestamps according to
computer date/time on message receival, and they are sorted in the chat history
by timestamp. For example, if the computer's date/time was one month in the
future when the messages were received, then after fixing the computer
date/time, new messages in Skype chat history will be added BEFORE the
incorrectly timestamped messages, making it very hard to use Skype chat until
the original future date is reached.

Uses Python's Tkinter GUI module, should run on all systems. A compiled EXE
has been provided for Windows.
